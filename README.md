# 🌱 SustainaTrack - Carbon Emission Tracker and Calculator

## 📖 Introduction
Everyday choices—like how we travel, eat, and use energy—contribute to climate change, yet most people lack tools to understand their personal impact. This project introduces a simple, quiz-based Carbon Footprint Calculator that helps users track emissions, get personalized tips, and build sustainable habits through a gamified experience.

## 📌 Problem Statement 
Despite growing awareness around climate change, most individuals lack simple and accessible tools to understand and manage their personal environmental impact. Existing carbon footprint calculators are often overly technical, lengthy, or unengaging, making them difficult for the average user to interact with regularly or meaningfully.

This complexity creates a gap between awareness and action, where users may know climate change is an issue but struggle to identify how their daily habits contribute to it or what steps they can take to improve. There is a clear need for a platform that simplifies carbon tracking, provides actionable insights, and motivates users to adopt sustainable practices through engaging features.

## ✅ Solution Proposed
This project offers an interactive, user-friendly platform that calculates an individual's carbon footprint using a simple quiz-based approach. By replacing complex forms with lifestyle-related questions, it delivers accurate emission estimates in an engaging format. The system provides personalized suggestions to help users reduce their environmental impact and includes a point-based reward mechanism to encourage consistent, sustainable behavior. Designed with scalability in mind, the platform is accessible across devices and aims to make carbon tracking practical, informative, and habit-forming.

## 🛠 Implementation and Platform Design
### Information Delivery Methods
- **Data Input**: Users input data in categories such as Shopping, Transport, Electricity, and Food.
- **Backend Processing**: Node.js processes inputs, calculates emissions, and ensures seamless communication between the frontend and database.
- **Instant Feedback**: The platform delivers real-time feedback and personalized insights through an interactive, user-friendly interface.

### Carbon Emission Categories and Reduction Awareness
- **Categories**: Shopping, Transport, Electricity, and Food.
- **Emission Impact**: Each category educates users on the environmental impact and offers reduction strategies (e.g., sustainable transport options, energy-efficient practices).
- **User-Focused Content**: The platform tailors information based on user inputs, encouraging sustainable behavior and helping users make informed decisions.

### Interactive Calculations and Gamification
- **Real-Time Calculations**: Users receive real-time feedback on their carbon footprint.
- **Gamification**: Points are awarded for sustainable actions, motivating continued participation.
- **Result Breakdown**: Detailed insights into carbon emissions by category are displayed, allowing users to track progress and visualize their environmental impact.

### Verification
- **Data Accuracy**: The platform includes validation mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of user inputs and calculated carbon footprints. 
- **User Feedback**: The platform allows users to report discrepancies or errors in the data, ensuring continuous improvement of the system.
- **Testing**: Postman and other testing tools are used for API testing to verify smooth communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project
1. Clone this Repository
2. **Database**: Create a MySQL database (e.g. `carbon_footprint`). In the `backend` folder, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`, and `JWT_SECRET`. Tables are created automatically on first run.
3. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
4. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

⚠️ Make sure Node.js, npm, and MySQL are installed on your system.  
💡 Run frontend and backend in two different terminals.
